Packages for ZyXEL NAS Devices

A few months ago, ZyXEL decided to turn off their FTP server that is used to serve Firmware/Packages to older NAS devices.
This would result in an empty packages list.
This will break many functions of the device, including enabling SSH, that can be used to update SMB1 to SMB2, and make the device usable on Windows 10 and newer.
To resolve this issue, i have gathered all packages, that can be downloaded from this repository.
Just add all the files to the folder named zy-pkgs and click on "Retrieve List From Internet".
All packages will now be available to install.
